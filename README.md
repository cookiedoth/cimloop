# Hardware costs of Vector Quantization

This is the repository for our final course project for MIT course Hardware Architecture for Deep Learning (6.5930). Here are the main files that are present in this repo.

- `report.pdf` – the report with description of the project and the results we've got
- `poster.pdf` – our poster
- `NestQuant.ipynb` – a Minispec notebook for 2 and 3 stage pipelined circuit for NestQuant dequantizer. The results can be reproduced, for example, at [6004hub.csail.mit.edu](6004hub.csail.mit.edu).
- `workspace/models/arch/1_macro/nestquant/_guide.ipynb` – the main notebook for running Timeloop results. The relevant architecture files are placed in the same directory as this notebook
